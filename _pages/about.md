About Me
======
I am a second-year PhD student in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. I currently research human-centered algorithm design as applied to decision-making systems in healthcare. My work is supervised by [Shion Guha](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/profile/shion-guha/) as part of the [Human-Centered Data Science Lab](https://hcds-uoft.ca/). 

I am interested in exploring the effects of AI and machine learning implementations in healthcare infrastructure, administrative efforts, and clinical endeavours. Find out more about my current project (in partnership with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health) [here](https://cifar.ca/ai/ai-and-society/cifar-solution-networks/ai-for-diabetes-prediction-and-prevention/).

My academic background includes a Master of Information - Data Science from the University of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Science (Honours) - Biochemistry from McGill University.

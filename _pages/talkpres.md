## Public Lectures

**Health Informatics Seminar Series.** March 2025. _Examining the Landscape of Human-Centered AI for Health Systems and Implications for Risk Prediction._ As computational power and access to data-driven modeling becomes increasingly prevalent in healthcare settings, artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive models are being more frequently integrated into decision-making, risk prediction, and diagnosis tasks. These models can produce biased, unjust results, leading to unintended consequences and placing individuals at a disadvantage when seeking care. As well, while AI models are often promoted as “cost-effective alternatives” aiming to reduce health system spending, the computational, societal, and environmental costs of developing and deploying these models are often not considered. In this seminar we will explore the landscape of medical and clinical AI models as well as the granularity with which computational costs are acknowledged. We will also discuss current work examining the development of predictive models for diabetes care in Ontario.
